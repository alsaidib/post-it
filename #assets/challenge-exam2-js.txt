Set-up:
- Use a complete project with sass
- Set your page-background as page-bg.
- Set the font of the postit to: Cedarville Cursive (google font)
- Create an object constructor Postit()
- Every instance creates a message on the screen with a custom text on it
- Use an array with the different images to have a random background as the post-it image.
- Every post-it has a random rotation between -15 and +15 degrees
- Every post-it has the same size as the post-it image (the are all the same size)
- Every post-it has a random position but cannot be offscreen


Extension:
- Make sure that you can remove the post-it when clicking on a garbage-icon in the topright corner
- Create a for-loop that creates 5 post-it's on the screen that use an array containing 20 funny quotes.
- Show them with a delay of 666ms
- make sure you can drag each one of them to change its position on the screen (use greensock draggable)

HAVE FUN !!!
